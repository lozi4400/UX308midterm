The Colosseum is located in Rome, Italy. It was originally built for the gladiator fights and public spectacles back in 70-80 AD. Now it is one of the most touristed place in Rome. The Colosseum is still seen as a symbol of Imperial Rome and has links to the Roman Catholic Church. Millions of people a year visit this iconic attraction in Rome. These tourists each year come to Rome, entering the Colosseum to view the interior arena where the floor is open to show the many underground passages that were used to transport animals and gladiators to the stage. The Colosseum has also become embedded within the modern city centre of Rome, rather than on the outskirts of the ancient city, making it easily accessible to all tourists.
