The history in Rome has always been my favourite. There is so much to learn about the city. Each time i visit Rome, I am still amazed by the architecture and history around me. Over the years, I have become interested in this history and the Colosseum is a central point in this history. The Colosseum is located in Rome, Italy. It was originally built for the gladiator fights and public spectacles back in 70-80 AD. Now it is one of the most touristed place in Rome. The Colosseum is still seen as a symbol of Imperial Rome and has links to the Roman Catholic Church. Millions of people a year visit this iconic attraction in Rome. During the summer, thousands of tourists visit this incredible site in Rome, entering to view the interior arena. The stage at the base of the Colosseum is opened up and below, a network of  passageways once used to transport wild animals and gladiators to the arena are opened up to the visitors of Rome. Over the many centuries, the Colosseum became embedded within the modern city centre of Rome, rather than on the outskirts of the ancient city. This resulted in Rome emerging into the historical city as we know it today.
