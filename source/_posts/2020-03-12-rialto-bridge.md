The city of Venice is surrounded by water, the only way to get through the city is by car or by some form of water transportation (a boat, watertaxi, gondola, etc.). In this case, bridges have become very useful and are a requirement in a city like Venice. The Rialto Bridge runs across the Grand Canal in Italy and is the oldest of four bridges spanning across the Canal. The Grand Canal was found to be the ideal crossing point, as it was narrower than other spots. It connects the districts of San Marco and San Polo. The bridge was rebuilt 3 times before it was built in stone, as it stands today. The Rialto bridge has three ways to get from one side to the other, the first being a middle walk-way that is lined with stores on each side. The other two passageways are stairways on the backside of the stores that is visible from the Grand Canal.
