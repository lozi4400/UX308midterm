When travelling through Italy, Pisa was a must take stop along the way. I wanted to see the tower with my own eyes as in pictures and when others talk about it, the lean is quite noticeable to everyone. Sitting at about a 4 degree angle, the Leaning Tower of Pisa is a free standing bell tower in Pisa, Italy. It is also a cathedral for the city of Pisa. It became so popular as a result of unstable foundation at the base of the tower. The tower began to lean due to the soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight. As the tower neared completion of construction the lean got worse. Since the completion of the Tower of Pisa, it has been restructured from 1994 to 2001, as a result of the tower reaching a lean of 5.5 degrees, which was then later reduced to 3.97 degrees after the restabilization. As the Tower of Pisa is known for this incredible phenomenon of the lean, many tourists gather around each and everyday to see and climb this miracle of a building. This was one of the most interesting building structures that i have seen across Italy and it is very unique for how small the city of Pisa is.
