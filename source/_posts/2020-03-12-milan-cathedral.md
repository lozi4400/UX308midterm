The Milan Cathedral, also known as the Duomo di Milano, is the cathedral church of Milan. This is one location in Milan that I would like to visit. I have yet to see the cathedral in person, however, I have learned about it in school. It is dedicated to the Nativity of St Mary and is the largest church in Italy. The Duomo is located in the city centre of Milan. It took six centuries to complete the construction of the Cathedral. Over this time period, different architects, sculptors and artists made their professional contribution to the Duomo. The Milan Duomo resulted in a unique architectural work, which combines the Gothic style with the traditional Lombard architecture. One of the sculptures, Giuseppe Perego, sculpted a golden copper statue in 1774 that was located at the highest point of the cathedral and is known as the Madonnina, which later became the symbol of Milan. Despite that the Duomo became a tourist attraction in Milan, the cathedral continues to operate and inside religious services are carried out regularly.
