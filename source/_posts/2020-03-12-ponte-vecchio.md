The Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore was the major church in Florence in the Renaissance period, however, most of the construction occurred in the fourteenth century. Florence was seen to be a very wealth city during the pre-Renaissance era, often comparing themselves to that of ancient Rome. Their wealth came from the account of its textile trade and they wanted to prove their wealth to the neighbouring cities. They managed to create an extraordinary building in Florence. The exterior is has a  geometric patterning of its face, made from encrusted marble, which at the time, showed a great amount of wealth throughout Italy. The exterior is covered in a decorative mix of pink, white and green marble. The marble continues in the interior of the cathedral as the flooring. At each of the three entrances of the cathedral in Florence, there is a large brass door depicting either: charity among the founders of Florentine philanthropic institutions; Christ enthroned with Mary and John the Baptist; or the Florentine artisans, merchants and humanists, each sculpted by hand.
